    "summary": "I am a programmer with eight years of working experience, which consists mainly of various projects based on Java platform, complex database applications, data analyses and presentations.\n\nI have earned a master degree in Software Engineering and a bachelor degree in Computer Science. Through my studies, I have gained sizable experience in working with Open and Linked Data, as well as in implementing and extending classic dialog systems.\n\nWhile programming is not only my job, but also long-time passion, I consider myself more of people person than a run-of-the-mill programmer. I truly enjoy connecting with non-technical people, understanding their needs in return, and translating them into elegant solutions based on working code. I welcome any opportunities that will allow me to continue to do so!",
